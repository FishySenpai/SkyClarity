      "question": "Fly during the working week",
      "answer": "Opting to take your flight during the working week can save you money. Flights departing over this period – especially Tuesdays and Wednesdays – are cheaper, mainly because these days are less popular to travel on."
    },
    {
      "question": "Have a look at airline websites",
      "answer": "Many airline websites have made it simpler to identify the inexpensive days to fly by displaying a \"calendar view\" booking system. This system allows you to scan prices ranging across the week that you are searching."

      "question": "Consider flights with less-popular departure times",
      "answer": "You may also get a bargain flight if you’re willing to fly at an early hour. It may well be less expensive to fly at 6 am than at later times due to that time spot being less popular. The only problem you could face is getting to the airport at this time; make sure that public transport is running if you can’t take a taxi or get a lift to the airport."

      "answer": "This may sound like I’m stating the obvious, but you’d be surprised at the number of people who settle for a price without first shopping around and doing some research. We suggest you have a look for bargains on the Trip.com app. The Trip.com Save & Fly browser extension is a big help when learning how to get cheap flight tickets. While you’re looking for airline tickets online, the extension notifies you of whether the exact same flight is available on Trip.com at a better price. It’s completely free to install and use, and it takes some of the pressure off booking your tickets."

      "question": "How does Skyscanner's car rental comparison tool work?",
      "answer": "We use the same technology that powers our award-winning flight search to scan the web for car rental deals from most major providers. So you can see every price in one place, instead of having to search and compare across a dozen different car rental websites. Currently, you'll be able to find the lowest price for car rental in 18,000 pick-up locations globally right here in our search."

    {
      "question": "How does Skyscanner's car rental comparison tool work?",
      "answer": "We account for any extra fees including insurance, local taxes and airport surcharges in the price shown when you search. Many of our insurance partners offer an excess refund option, which may prove cheaper than the rental companies' excess waiver offered at the rental counter. Additional drivers or child seats can be purchased when you pick up the car."
