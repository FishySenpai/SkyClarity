        "review": "Inevitably, perhaps, our stay at the Grand Central was fantastic. This was our only 5 star hotel stay in our 3-weeks in India so we don’t have anything to compare it with, but its splendour, comfort and quality shone through in every detail. We opted for the Executive Club Exclusive because it has the window seat which made for a fabulous spot to relax. We had the breakfast which, though primarily Indian fare, catered for all tastes. Uber is so good in Mumbai that to us it wasn’t that important which neighbourhood we stayed in, but Parel isn’t the loveliest of locales.",
